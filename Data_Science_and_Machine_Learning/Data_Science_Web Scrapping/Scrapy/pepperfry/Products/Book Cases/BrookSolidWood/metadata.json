Channel your inner bohemian self with a furniture line that\u2019s part industrial, part distressed and 100% avant garde. Industrial Style depicts a raw, unfinished, earthy and elemental look. As the name implies, it draws inspiration from warehouses and urban lofts \u2013 it\u2019s a style which celebrates contrasts. It\u2019s coming together of opposing materials to create a cohesive format. It\u2019s a fusion of old with the new, the bold with muted colours, the shiny with distressed finish, the knotty with the even tones, the solids with the patterned fabrics, or the functional with the outlandish. Bookcase is a compartmentalized furniture structure which creates a clean but classy geometric look to house your books in an enclosed space. Bookcases are bookshelves with an advantage of having either glass panels or shutters to organize and display your collection of books and other paraphernalia.
