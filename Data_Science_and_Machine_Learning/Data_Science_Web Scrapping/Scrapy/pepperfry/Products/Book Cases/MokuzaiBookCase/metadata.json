Crafted for compact homes, the range is clean and convenient and has an understated design aesthetic that adapts to any space. Mid Century Modern is a throwback to the design style of mid 50s and 60s. It is a minimalist design style which is fuss free with key design influences like splayed legs, geometric graphic patterns, natural organic shapes, mixed elements and contrasting textures. No ornate furnishings and excessive decoration for this distinct vintage style. Bookcase is a compartmentalized furniture structure which creates a clean but classy geometric look to house your books in an enclosed space. Bookcases are bookshelves with an advantage of having either glass panels or shutters to organize and display your collection of books and other paraphernalia."}
