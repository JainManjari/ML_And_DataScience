It uses a combination of vinyl, steel, plastic, glass or wood having monochromatic colors and sleek silhouettes. Modern furniture lives at the intersection of clean lines and relaxed comfort accentuating form and function. Bookcase is a compartmentalized furniture structure which creates a clean but classy geometric look to house your books in an enclosed space. Bookcases are bookshelves with an advantage of having either glass panels or shutters to organize and display your collection of books and other paraphernalia."}
