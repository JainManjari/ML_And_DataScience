A swing is a hanging seat, often found at playgrounds for children and now also popularly used as items of indoor furniture. The seat of a swing may be suspended from chains or ropes. Once a swing is in motion, it continues to oscillate like a pendulum until external interference or drag brings it to a halt."}
