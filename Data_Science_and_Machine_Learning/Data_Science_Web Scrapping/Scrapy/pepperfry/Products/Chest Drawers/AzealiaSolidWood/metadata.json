Channel your inner bohemian self with a furniture line thats part industrial, part distressed and 100% avant garde. Industrial Style depicts a raw, unfinished, earthy and elemental look. As the name implies, it draws inspiration from warehouses and urban lofts  its a style which celebrates contrasts. Its coming together of opposing materials to create a cohesive format. Its a fusion of old with the new, the bold with muted colours, the shiny with distressed finish, the knotty with the even tones, the solids with the patterned fabrics, or the functional with the outlandish. A chest of drawers, also called a bureau, is a type of cabinet that has multiple parallel, horizontal drawers usually stacked one above another. Chests of drawers have traditionally been used for storing clothing, especially underwear, socks, and other items not normally hung in or otherwise stored in a closet. They are usually placed in a bedroom for this purpose but can actually be used to store anything that will fit inside.
