A chest of drawers, also called a bureau, is a type of cabinet that has multiple parallel, horizontal drawers usually stacked one above another. Chests of drawers have traditionally been used for storing clothing, especially underwear, socks, and other items not normally hung in or otherwise stored in a closet. They are usually placed in a bedroom for this purpose but can actually be used to store anything that will fit inside. Contemporary is very current and in trend, of the here and now. Its a very fluid, simplistic style which takes its cues from the in-vogue polishes, textures and colors of the season and is bereft of any ornamentation or embellishments."}
